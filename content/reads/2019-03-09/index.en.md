Title: Microservice Architecture at Medium
---

[Microservice Architecture at Medium](https://medium.engineering/microservice-architecture-at-medium-9c33805eb74f) (medium.engineering)

> At Medium, our technical stack started with a monolithic Node.js app back in 2012. We have built a couple of satellite services, but we havenâ€™t created a strategy to adopt the microservice architecture systematically. As the system becomes more complex and the team grows, we moved to a microservice architecture in early 2018. In this post, we want to share our experiences of doing it effectively and avoiding microservice syndromes.

It's been years since we started talk about switching to microservices architecture from monolithic app. It's worth reading how large scale companies have successfully went through the switch and what are their principles and strategies to get full benefits of microservices.
