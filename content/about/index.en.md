Hey there, I'm Tony Xu, currently working for LinkedIn as a Software Engineer. I love technology and always follow the advancements in technology, especially in the topic of web, mobile, and AI. I have a passion for designing and creating things, notably with code. When I'm not coding, I enjoy travelling with family and make [travel videos](https://tonyloveshan.com/vlogs). I live in the San Francisco bay area with my fianc√©e Helen.

I started this blog in 2018. In this blog, I share things on my mind, my learnings, and my interests of all kind. Feel free to exchange ideas with me with below options:
