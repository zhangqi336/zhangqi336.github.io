> The longer a technology is on the market, the safer investment it is.

> Don’t rush to learn new technology – it has a high probability of dying.

> Time will show which technology is worth investing in. Time is your best advisor. Learn to wait.
>
> Remember – frameworks, libraries and tools come and go. Time is precious.

I loves to learn new technologies, which often turned out to be just learning new frameworks/tools. I have learned Angular, Vue, and React just to build a blog in different ways. Instead of spending time learning new frameworks/tools, we should focus more on fundamental things (Web, HTTP, REST, JS) that empower these frameworks.
