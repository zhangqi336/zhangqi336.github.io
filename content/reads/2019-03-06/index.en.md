The Silicon Valley author described is exactly what I see in the Silivon Valley. What's more is some smart minds I see are also talking about buying homes, stock investment, and job promotions.

If you are not living in Silicon Valley, let's go with the author and get to see the sides of the Silicon Valley you may not know.
